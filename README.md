# my_datascience_progress

This repository tracks my progress in learning Data Science.  
It contains small coding tasks, experiments, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects.

Contents

1. Task 1 — Custom number replacement function
- Implemented a function similar to FizzBuzz  
- Used loops, conditionals, and modulo operations  
- Practiced Python basics and logical thinking

2. Task 2 — Word statistics
- Took a text input and extracted:  
  - number of words  
  - the most frequent word  
  - set of unique words  
- Practiced using `Counter`, `sets`, and string preprocessing

3. Titanic Dataset — Exploratory Data Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)
Includes:
- Survival by gender  
- Survival by passenger class  
- Female survival by passenger class  
- Age distribution by survival status  
- Correlation heatmap (selected features)  
- Average fare by survival status  

Used tools:
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib

To learn and document core Data Science skills, including:
- Working with datasets
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Python fundamentals
- Visualization and statistics

More tasks and notebooks will be added as I keep learning.
